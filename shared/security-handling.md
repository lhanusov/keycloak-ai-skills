# Security handling

Read the current [Keycloak security policy](https://www.keycloak.org/security) and applicable repository `SECURITY.md` when security handling is relevant. Check feature maturity, experimental/preview treatment, dependency-report routing, reproduction requirements, and AI disclosure. Explain material policy conflicts and use the applicable private runbook or downstream process when needed.

A dependency alert or vulnerable version alone does not establish exploitability in Keycloak: investigate use and reachability of the vulnerable functionality. Known third-party CVEs have a public reporting route under Keycloak's policy; unpublished Keycloak vulnerabilities require the policy's security-team handling. Do not assume every security-related report follows the same route.

Keep private text, confidential identifiers, secrets, and unpublished exploit details out of public searches and tools not authorized for that material. Use non-sensitive public terms or authorized private sources. Match every deliverable to its audience. Public reports and comments must exclude private links and sensitive details. If audience or disclosure status is uncertain, mark technical findings for private review and draft a minimal public-safe comment. Avoid amplifying exploit details already exposed publicly. A public advisory or fix PR does not authorize disclosure of a newly discovered bypass.

For a requested security-submission draft, follow current policy, disclose AI assistance, and accurately state reproduction and human-review status. An unvalidated draft is not ready for submission. Draft reporter replies separately from internal rationale when the workflow requires them, respecting the recipient's access.

Drafting does not authorize posting, contacting security teams/reporters, submitting reports, or requesting CVE assignment. Use explicit authorization for the action and destination; honor authorization already given. Bot-triggering comments can perform those actions and need the same scope of authorization.
