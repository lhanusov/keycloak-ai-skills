# Keycloak AI Skills

Reusable AI skills for Keycloak skill authoring, security triage, and pull request review. The current package version is `0.2.0`.

| Skill | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [add-skill](skills/add-skill/SKILL.md) | Turn a task description into a reusable skill. |
| [triage-cve](skills/triage-cve/SKILL.md) | Analyze an issue, check duplicates, classify security impact, assess CVSS, urgency, and embargo handling, and draft a report, comment, and workflow handoff. |
| [review-pr](skills/review-pr/SKILL.md) | Review fixes, enhancements, and new features for requirements, specification applicability, completeness, regressions, and valid findings; draft a review. |

The shared instructions follow [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io/specification). The root `plugin.json` follows [Agent Plugins 1.0](https://agent-plugins.org/specification). Small client integrations all use the same `skills/` directory.

## Install

Publish this repository before using these GitHub installation commands. Use a current client with plugin or extension support.

Codex:

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add lhanusov/keycloak-ai-skills
codex plugin add keycloak-ai-skills@keycloak-skills
```

Claude Code:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add lhanusov/keycloak-ai-skills
claude plugin install keycloak-ai-skills@keycloak-skills
```

GitHub Copilot CLI:

```bash
copilot plugin marketplace add lhanusov/keycloak-ai-skills
copilot plugin install keycloak-ai-skills@keycloak-skills
```

Gemini CLI:

```bash
gemini extensions install https://github.com/lhanusov/keycloak-ai-skills
```

IBM Bob Shell:

```bash
bob extensions install https://github.com/lhanusov/keycloak-ai-skills
```

Bob Shell uses an extension context file to find the shared skills. Bob IDE has separate [skill discovery](https://bob.ibm.com/docs/ide/features/skills); the Shell command does not install an IDE plugin. Other Agent Skills clients can use the same skill folders through their own installer.

## Use

Start a new session after installation and ask:

```text
Use add-skill to create a skill for reviewing Keycloak configuration.
```

In Claude Code, use `/keycloak-ai-skills:add-skill`. In Codex, use `$add-skill`. For discovery paths and activation details, see [client support](skills/add-skill/references/client-support.md). Verified versions and limitations are recorded in [compatibility checks](docs/compatibility.md).

New collection skills go in `skills/`. Standalone skills go in the target tool's discovery directory; `add-skill` identifies that tool before choosing a path.

To triage a specific issue, provide its URL, tracker-qualified ID, or text:

```text
Use triage-cve to analyze <issue-url>, check for duplicates, and draft a report and short comment.
```

Triage also records urgency, disclosure/embargo reasoning, and the next responsible role or team. For the Keycloak private workflow, it drafts tracker changes and a handoff using the current runbook and authorized sources. It keeps CVSS, project severity, CVE status, and disclosure decisions distinct; proposed actions require authorization before execution.

To review a proposed fix, enhancement, or new feature, provide a PR URL or a diff with base/head revisions and issue/design context:

```text
Use review-pr to review <pr-url> and draft an evidence-based review.
```

Optionally request `bug`, `feature`, `hardening`, or `vulnerability` mode; `feature` covers enhancements and new capabilities. Otherwise the skill selects relevant checks from the evidence and states any uncertainty. All modes include specification applicability, finding validation, tests, compatibility, and baseline security checks. Feature review adds acceptance, design, completeness, and adoption checks; additional security guidance is loaded for relevant controls and trust boundaries as well as fixes. A vulnerability fix does not need a CVE. `triage-cve` remains optional for separate issue triage and severity assessment.

For example:

```text
Use review-pr in feature mode to review <pr-url> against <design-or-issue-url>.
```

The skill's [review guidance](skills/review-pr/references/review-guidance.md) maps CNCF, Linux Foundation, OpenSSF, OWASP, Google, Apache TVM, and IBM sources to applicable checks. It distinguishes Keycloak requirements from external recommendations and historical context.

In Codex, invoke `$review-pr`; in Claude Code, use `/keycloak-ai-skills:review-pr`. These skills draft findings without posting them. New collection skills become available after the updated plugin is released and installed; start a new session after updating. Structural validation does not verify client discovery or invocation.

## Maintain

Keep shared metadata in `plugin.json` and instructions in `skills/`. The Codex catalog is `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`; Claude and Copilot share `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`. Claude, Gemini, and Bob Shell have small compatibility manifests. `BOB.md` routes Bob Shell to the shared skills without duplicating their instructions.

When releasing, keep the version identical in `plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `gemini-extension.json`, and `bob-extension.json`, and update the version stated in this README. Keep shared descriptions consistent across these manifests. The marketplace catalogs reference the package and have no version field. Checks reject mismatched metadata and catalogs. There is no metadata generator.

With Python 3.10+:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python scripts/check-package.py
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

CI runs these checks on Linux and Windows with Python 3.10 and 3.14. The validator checks containment, relative symlinks, bounded YAML without aliases, and CommonMark links outside code examples. Scaffold markers use `@@ADD_SKILL_...@@` and are checked in UTF-8 resources outside `assets/`, with a 1 MiB limit per checked file. Structural checks do not prove client activation.
