# Compatibility checks

The shared skill uses Agent Skills frontmatter, relative resource paths, and ordinary Markdown instructions. Root `plugin.json` is an Agent Plugins 1.0 package. Client-specific files handle installation; they do not contain separate copies of the workflow.

| Client | Integration | Local verification |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex CLI 0.164.0 | Root plugin and `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` | Fresh installation, discovery, and headless invocation passed with the portable manifest and shared skill. The generated skill also passed the bundled validator. |
| Claude Code 2.1.311 | `.claude-plugin/` | Native validation, local marketplace installation, and component discovery passed; inventory lists `add-skill`. Invocation has not been tested. |
| GitHub Copilot CLI 1.0.104 | Root plugin; shared `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` | Local marketplace installation reported one skill installed and enabled. Invocation has not been tested. |
| Gemini CLI 0.65.0 | `gemini-extension.json`; shared `skills/` | Native validation, clean installation, and skill discovery passed; `add-skill` is enabled. Invocation has not been tested. |
| IBM Bob Shell 1.0.6 | `bob-extension.json` and `BOB.md` | Native extension validation passed. Installation and context-driven invocation have not been tested. |
| IBM Bob IDE | Agent Skills in Bob's discovery directories | Documented format compatibility; IDE installation and activation have not been tested here. |

Local Python checks run on Linux with Python 3.14.7. CI covers Linux and Windows with Python 3.10 and 3.14; hosted runs start after publication.

Installation, discovery, and invocation are separate checks. No GitHub-hosted installation has been tested because this checkout has not been published. Codex created the requested test skill under `skills/summarize-notes/`; automatic discovery of that generated standalone skill was not tested. An earlier test's sandbox made `.agents/` read-only. Temporary Codex installation was removed and the original configuration restored; other installation checks use temporary client settings.

Gemini's first installation attempt hit the sandbox's OS user-lookup restriction. A clean reinstall outside that sandbox completed successfully. Claude's validator reports optional marketplace-description, author, and public-directory icon warnings; local installation and discovery pass without them.
